# Pizzabulous

A primitive version of a pizza review aggregator.

## Requirements

- Build a web page that accepts the name of a pizza restaurant in New York and displays the n most recent Yelp reviews for this restaurant, where n is a user input (assume n < 10).
- The web page should also display the average score (0-5) of the relevant reviews
- Python.
- use any Python packages/frameworks
- Yelpâ€™s API does not support retrieving reviews, so you will have to scrape the data yourself.

## Installation

### Using Docker

`docker run standyro/pizzabulous:latest`

### Mac OS X

Python 2.7
Using virtual environments

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
